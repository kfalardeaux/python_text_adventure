# python_text_adventure

(rework of an old python project from a previous class)

This is a project from one of my prior college classes, in which I was instructed to create a Text Advneture game in python via VS Code.


Below are the requirements for the project, taken from the PDF posted on the grading site:

> Game must include at least 6 different "rooms" the player can explore
> Game must include at least two items that must be collected to beat the game
> Game must include at least one text entry "puzzle":
      > On interacting with an item, the player is asked to type in a number, name or answer to a riddle
      > If the player inputs the correct response, they either receive an item or are allowed into a new room
      > If the player inputs an incorrect response, they exit the prompt and must interact with the item again to try again
      > If the player inputs an incorrect response, it must be obvious to the player that they entered the wrong answer
> Game must include a save/load feature:
      > Aside from navigating the rooms, the player should have the option to save or load their game
      > Saving the game should store relevant game information as plain text in a text file in the same location as the .py script (or in a binary file using pickle)
      > Loading the game should reset all items and game state to what was stored in the text file
      > If the player attempts to load a game when a save file doesn't exist, the game should handle itgracefully and not crash
> The game must be winnable
> The game must gracefully handle incorrect input
> Your code should be well commented to describe the following:
      > What each variable/function/class does
      > How the game works
