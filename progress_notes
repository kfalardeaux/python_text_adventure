I have uploaded all relevent files and information in order to work on this project.  
When I submitted this assignment back in class, I was one of the only ones to do so, and so it ended up being considered a 'bonus' project in the class.  Thus, I did not receieve a true grading or critique of the work.


      I have not yet carefully scrutinized the project, but I do remember some of the issues I had in the code that I never resolved:

      1) Save/Load - I think I remember that it was not properly saving and loading game information to a file.  I discovered a part of my textbook later on that I marked to read that I think will fix the issue, but I never went back and actually did it.

      2) I just did a short and sweet play of the game, and the string input doesn't seem to recognize lowercase y as the same as Y, which should be fixed.

      3) Not technically incorrect, but the game could use some more helpful hints.  It didn't take me long to resolve the puzzles, but maybe I could add another variable that tracks incorrect attempts and gives more and more hints.  Maybe after like 5 it's nearly a gimmie. 


That was the extent of the project, but with what I learned in java I want to attempt to apply some of the more advanced skills here if I can.  
We never went too much into the OOP ability of python, and mostly worked top down.  So I want to see if I can integrate OOP concepts here, in a way that stays cohesive to what I already have.  
Ideally I don't want to completely redo this from scratch to do that, though, so I'll see how it goes.
Another thing I want to really check for is whether the code is clear and concise.  I know I'll likely being working in teams once I get into the industry, 
so I need to make sure that anyone looking at any of my code would understand at a glance what my intents are and what my variables mean.  Glancing at the variables I used,
some of them are probably a little confusing, honestly.  


My primary objective first will be to address issues 1 and 2 listed above.
